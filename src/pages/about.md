  The phrase "Pie in the sky" means too good to be true! It also represents the
  idea of heaven, you die to get a pie in the sky :-) We don't know if heaven is
  real. But we believe that the planet we live on can be one.

Mother Earth is the only Pie in the Sky (The one we don't have any doubt about) that's why we generate less waste, use bio-degradable plates and cutlery, give away what's not good to be sold and feed the leftovers to a cowshed nearby! Visit us for a heavenly Pie coz there's only one Pie in the Sky.
